                    <p>
                        The importance of sports and fitness in one’s life is
                        invaluable.
                        Playing sports inculcates team spirit, develops
                        strategic
                        analytical thinking, leadership skills, goal setting and
                        risk
                        taking. A fit and healthy individual leads to an equally
                        healthy
                        society and strong nation.

                    <p>
                        Sports is an extremely important component for the
                        overall
                        development of our nation. India, in the last few years
                        has made
                        steady progress in the field of sports. This tremendous
                        potential
                        needs to be showcased at a global platform. It’s time we
                        inspire
                        young talent, give them top-notch infrastructure and
                        training of
                        the highest level. We need to inculcate a strong spirit
                        of
                        participation in sports that enables players to
                        demonstrate their
                        true potential. Only then can India realise its dream of
                        becoming
                        a sports super power.
